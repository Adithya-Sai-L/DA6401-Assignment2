# DA6401-Assignment2
Build and experiment with CNN based image classifiers using a subset of the iNaturalist dataset

Since the images are of different dimensions and the highest length and breadth of any image on both the train and test is 800, all the images will be padded to (800, 800) before being fed into the model.
